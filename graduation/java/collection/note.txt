#list
ArrayList is essentially an array. it's performance on add and remove is better that LinkedList
LinkedList is implemented as a double linked list. Its performance on add and remove is better than Arraylist, 
Vector is legacy, is similar with ArrayList, but it is synchronized.

#set
3 commonly used implementations of Set in Java: HashSet, TreeSet and LinkedHashSet
if we want a fast set, we should use HashSet
if we need a sorted set, then TreeSet should be used
if we want a set that can be read by following its insertion order, LinkedHashSet should be used.
