#eval and exec have these two differences:
#eval: take a single expression, return a value
#exec: take a block,             return None 
#
#1.eval accepts only a single expression, 
#  exec can take a code block that has Python statements: loops, try: except:, class and function/method definitions and so on.
#2.eval returns the value of the given expression, 
#  exec always returns None, ignores the return value from its code

a=5; a = eval('37 + a'); print a          #42
a=5; exec('a = 37 + a'); print a          #42 
a=5; eval('a = 37 + a')                   #SyntaxError: invalid syntax, you cannot evaluate a statement with eval
