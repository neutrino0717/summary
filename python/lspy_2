## _var, _func() are semiprivate and meant just for convention
## __var, __func() are actual meaning is just to namemangle to prevent accidental access
#  __var changed to _cls__var by interpreter to ensure that the name will not overlap with a similar name in another class
## __var__, __func__() are typically reserved for builtin methods/variables
