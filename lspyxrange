#xrange type is an immutable sequence which is commonly used for looping. 
#The advantage of xrange is that an xrange object will always take the same amount of memory, no matter the size of the range it represents.
#
#xragne only supports indexing, iteration, and the len() function.

s=xrange(5); print s, type(s) 
s= range(5); print s, type(s)
