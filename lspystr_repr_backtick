##str(), repr(), `` are three ways to convert objects to str
#str is a class, repr is a function
print str.__class__, repr.__class__
print str.__doc__
print repr.__doc__
##back tick is similar to str(), to trasform everything to string
print "my mom is " + `29`
##where everstr() works, repr() also works
print "my mom is " + repr(29)
